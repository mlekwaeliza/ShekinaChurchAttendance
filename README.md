## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm

### Installation

1. **Install dependencies** (from project root):
```bash
npm run install-all
```

This installs dependencies for both server and client.

2. **Configure environment**:
```bash
cp .env.example server/.env
```
Edit `server/.env` and set:
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Generate with: `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"`
- `NODE_ENV`: `development` or `production`

3. **Start the application**:
```bash
# In two terminals, or use:
npm start
```

This runs:
- Backend: http://localhost:3001
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000

4. **Initial Login**:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123`
   - **IMPORTANT**: Change the admin password after first login using the "Change Password" link in the navigation.

## CSV Format

Upload a CSV file with these columns:
```
MembershipID,FullName,Section,LeaderName,Phone,Email,Gender,AgeGroup
```

**Important**:
- `Section` must match exactly: "Holy Spirit", "Divine of God", "Glory of God", "Love of God"
- `LeaderName` will be used to create a leader account (first occurrence)
- `MembershipID` must be unique for each member
- Phone and Email are optional
- Gender and AgeGroup are optional for demographics

**Sample CSV**: See `data/sample.csv`

## Deployment

### Heroku / Railway
1. Push to Git repository
2. Add buildpack for Node.js
3. Set environment variables
4. Deploy

### VPS / Dedicated Server
1. Copy files to server
2. Run `npm ci --only=production`
3. Configure nginx as reverse proxy
4. Set up SSL (Let's Encrypt)
5. Use PM2 for process management: `pm2 start server/server.js`

### Local Production
```bash
NODE_ENV=production npm start
```

## Security Considerations

- **Default admin credentials**: Change immediately after first login. All users can change their own password.
- **Session secret**: Use a strong random value for `SESSION_SECRET` in production.
- **HTTPS**: Enable in production (set `cookie.secure: true`).
- **Database**: Back up regularly.
- **CSRF Protection**: Implemented using double-submit cookie pattern; verified on all state-changing requests.
- **Rate Limiting**: Enabled on all API endpoints (100 requests per 15 minutes per IP).
- **Security Headers**: Helmet middleware sets various HTTP headers for security.
- **Cookie Security**: Cookies are `httpOnly`, `sameSite=lax`, and `secure` in production.

## Future Enhancements (TODO)

- Password reset via email (currently admin can reset leader passwords manually)
- Mobile app (React Native)
- Bulk member editing
- Advanced reporting (PDF generation)
- Attendance prediction insights
- SMS integration for follow-ups
- Multi-language support
- Recurring service times management
- Two-factor authentication
- Audit logging
- Email notifications for absences

## Troubleshooting

**Database locked errors**: Ensure only one server instance is running. Delete `server/database.sqlite-wal` and `server/database.sqlite-shm` if present, then restart.

**CORS errors**: Ensure client URL matches `CLIENT_URL` in `.env`.

**CSV upload fails**: Check CSV headers match exactly. Use `data/sample.csv` as template.

**Session issues**: Clear browser cookies and restart server.
